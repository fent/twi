# twi

Command line tool to for Twitter's REST API.


# Usage

```bash
usage: twi (tweet|user) (id|screen_name) [filter]
```

# Motive

I work with the Twitter API. Sometimes looking up a Tweet's or user's metadata is useful. Twitter turned off the ability to simply go to a URL without oauth, so I thought this would be useful. 


# Install

    npm -g install twi
